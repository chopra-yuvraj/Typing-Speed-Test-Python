## Why Advanced Typing Speed Test?

As a B.Tech CSE student at VIT and a B.S Data Science student at IIT Madras, 
I spend countless hours typing code, reports, and assignments.
Also, my friends and I compete with each other in our typing Speeds.

### Key Features

  - 30+ Unique Texts - Each carefully crafted with 200 words covering diverse topics  
  - Auto-Completion - Tests end automatically when you complete the full text  
  - Random Selection - Different text every time you click "New Text"  
  - Flexible Modes - Complete text or timed challenges (60s, 120s, 300s)  
  - Real-Time Analytics - Live WPM, accuracy, progress, and error tracking  
  - Visual Feedback - Colour-coded highlighting for correct/incorrect/current text  
  - Progress History - Track your improvement over time with detailed statistics
